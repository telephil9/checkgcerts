checkgcerts
===========
Check gmail servers certificates (both imap and smtp) against local TLS thumbprints found in /sys/lib/tls/
Useful to know when thumbprints need to be updated.
This could be fully automated to automatically add new hashes to the files.

Build:
------
mk install

Usage:
checkgcerts >logfile >[2=1]

Look for certificates hashes in the logfile
